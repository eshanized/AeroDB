//! Commit Authority - WAL-based commit identity assignment
//!
//! Per MVCC_WAL_INTERACTION.md:
//! - The WAL is the sole source of truth for commit ordering
//! - Commit identities are assigned exactly once
//! - Assignment occurs as part of commit
//! - The ordering is total, strict, and replayable
//!
//! Per PHASE2_INVARIANTS.md §2.5:
//! - All committed versions have a total, deterministic order
//! - Preserved across restarts
//! - Reproducible during WAL replay
//! - No ties or ambiguous positions
//!
//! This module provides the CommitAuthority which:
//! - Tracks the highest observed commit identity (from WAL replay)
//! - Provides the next commit identity for new commits
//! - Does NOT store state outside the WAL
