# PERFORMANCE OBSERVABILITY — PHASE 3

## Status

- Phase: **3**
- Authority: **Normative**
- Scope: **Measurement-only, non-influential**
- Dependencies:
  - PHASE3_VISION.md
  - PHASE3_INVARIANTS.md
  - PHASE3_PROOF_RULES.md
  - PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md
  - CRITICAL_PATHS.md
  - SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE.md

This document defines the **only allowed observability mechanisms**
for performance analysis in Phase 3.

If observability influences behavior, correctness, ordering, or timing,
it violates Phase 3 invariants and is forbidden.

---

## 1. Purpose

Phase 3 requires insight into performance **without changing semantics**.

This document defines:
- What performance data may be collected
- Where instrumentation may exist
- What instrumentation MUST NOT do
- How determinism is preserved

Observability exists to **observe**, never to **decide**.

---

## 2. Observability Principle

### OBSERVABILITY PRINCIPLE (Binding)

> Observability MUST be strictly passive.

This means:
- Observability may record
- Observability may count
- Observability may timestamp
- Observability may expose metrics

It may **never**:
- Influence control flow
- Influence scheduling
- Influence batching
- Influence retry logic
- Influence resource usage decisions

If removing observability changes behavior, observability is incorrect.

---

## 3. Permitted Observability Outputs

The following outputs are permitted:

### 3.1 Metrics

- Counters
- Gauges
- Histograms
- Deterministic timers

Metrics MUST:
- Be monotonic where applicable
- Have explicit units
- Be emitted in deterministic order

---

### 3.2 Logs

- Structured logs
- Event logs
- Lifecycle logs

Logs MUST:
- Be append-only
- Never gate behavior
- Never suppress errors

---

### 3.3 Traces (Internal Only)

- Internal execution spans
- Phase boundaries
- Critical path markers

Traces MUST:
- Be disabled by default
- Not alter execution shape
- Not allocate unbounded memory

---

## 4. Forbidden Observability Patterns

The following patterns are **explicitly forbidden**:

- Metric-driven branching
- Threshold-based behavior changes
- Adaptive batching using metrics
- Backpressure driven by observability
- Sampling that affects execution
- Best-effort metric emission
- Dropping metrics silently
- Async observability affecting ordering

Observability MUST NOT introduce feedback loops.

---

## 5. Determinism Requirements

### 5.1 Deterministic Emission

Observability output MUST be:

- Deterministically ordered
- Independent of scheduling
- Independent of timing variance

For identical executions:
- Metric sequences MUST be identical
- Log sequences MUST be identical (excluding timestamps if explicitly allowed)

---

### 5.2 Timestamp Rules

Timestamps:
- MAY be recorded
- MUST NOT be interpreted
- MUST NOT affect control flow

Timestamps are diagnostic only.

---

## 6. Placement Rules

### 6.1 Critical Path Instrumentation

Instrumentation MAY exist on critical paths ONLY if:

- It does not allocate unbounded memory
- It does not block
- It does not perform I/O
- It does not acquire new locks

If instrumentation adds blocking or contention, it is invalid.

---

### 6.2 Non-Critical Paths

Heavier instrumentation MAY exist on non-critical paths ONLY if:

- It is explicitly documented
- It is disableable
- It does not influence critical paths

---

## 7. Error Handling in Observability

- Observability failures MUST NOT affect execution
- Metrics emission failures MUST be ignored safely
- Logging failures MUST NOT suppress errors

If observability fails, the system continues unmodified.

---

## 8. Interaction with Optimizations

Optimizations MUST NOT:

- Read observability outputs
- Infer state from metrics
- Use observability to tune behavior
- Depend on observability being enabled

Observability MUST remain orthogonal to optimization logic.

---

## 9. Configuration Rules

### 9.1 Enablement

- Observability may be enabled or disabled at startup
- Enablement MUST NOT change behavior
- Enablement MUST NOT affect recovery

---

### 9.2 Runtime Changes

Runtime observability toggling is allowed ONLY if:

- It does not alter code paths
- It does not alter allocation patterns
- It does not alter execution order

If toggling changes execution shape, it is forbidden.

---

## 10. Observability and Failure Model

Observability MUST be correct under failures:

- Crash during metric emission
- Crash during logging
- Partial observability output

Failure outcomes:
- MUST NOT corrupt WAL
- MUST NOT corrupt snapshots
- MUST NOT affect recovery

Observability state is non-authoritative and discardable.

---

## 11. Testing Requirements

Observability MUST be tested to prove:

- Removal does not change behavior
- Enablement does not change behavior
- Failures in observability do not affect execution

Tests MUST:
- Compare observable DB behavior with and without observability
- Pass all Phase 1 and Phase 2 regressions unmodified

---

## 12. Explicit Non-Goals

Performance observability does NOT aim to:

- Auto-tune AeroDB
- Adapt execution strategies
- Replace profiling tools
- Predict performance

It exists only to **measure what already happens**.

---

## 13. Proof Obligations

Any Phase 3 optimization that adds observability MUST:

- Reference this document
- Prove passivity
- Prove determinism
- Prove disablement safety

If proof is omitted, optimization is invalid.

---

## 14. Final Rule

> Observability that influences behavior  
> is no longer observability — it is control logic.

Phase 3 permits measurement only.
All decision-making remains explicit and semantic.
