## Key Features

!!! note "Production Readiness"
    AeroDB is designed for mission-critical systems where data loss or corruption is unacceptable.

### :material-check-decagram: Correctness First
- **Strict Schema Enforcement**: No schemaless writes
- **Deterministic Query Execution**: Predictable performance
- **Crash Safety**: WAL-backed durability for every write

### :material-server-network: Robust Infrastructure
- **Leader-Follower Replication**: Atomic failover with split-brain protection
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Consistent snapshots and restoration
- **Zero-Dependency**: Self-contained binary, easy self-hosting

### :material-view-dashboard: Modern Developer Experience
- **Admin Dashboard**: Visual management of data, users, and cluster
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: WebSocket-based live updates
- **Serverless Functions**: Integrated WASM runtime

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into clear sections matching the system's architecture:

1.  **Core System**: Fundamental invariants, storage engine, and lifecycle.
2.  **MVCC**: Multi-Version Concurrency Control implementation details.
3.  **Replication**: Distributed consensus, failover, and data synchronization.
4.  **Performance**: Optimization strategies, proof rules, and benchmarks.
5.  **Developer Experience**: SDKs, UI, and observability tools.
6.  **Implementation Phases**: Detailed roadmap and architectural decisions for each phase.
